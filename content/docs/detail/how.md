Healthcare synthetic data is typically produced via:
- **Statistical methods:** Parametric models (e.g., multivariate Gaussian) or bootstrapping of real data summaries  
- **Machine learning models:** Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), or diffusion models  

Popular open-source tools:
- **SDV (Synthetic Data Vault):** A Python library offering tabular, sequential, and relational synthesis  
- **Faker:** Great for generating realistic-looking demo values (names, dates, addresses)  
- **Synthpop (R):** For rapid prototyping of health survey data

**Best practices:**
1. **Assess quality:** Compare marginal and joint distributions of real vs. synthetic data  
2. **Test on real workflows:** Run existing analysis pipelines (e.g., predictive models, dashboards) to ensure compatibility  
3. **Iterate & refine:** Tune your synthesizer to balance realism with privacy (e.g., differentially private GANs)

By following these guidelines, you can confidently integrate synthetic data into your clinical research, machine-learning experiments, and software demosâ€”without ever touching real patient records.
