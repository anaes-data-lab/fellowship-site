In brief, synthetic data is data created with the shape of a dataset (with similar medians, means and standard deviations, for example) but is an entirely unrelated dataset without sensitive data (dates, names, UR numbers etc.)

This allows exploration and building of data analysis scripts without the confidentiality concerns that usually accompany this process. And once finished - the script can be run *without modification on the original dataset*. So cool.
